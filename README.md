# Tip-Calculator

The Tip Calculator calculates tip amount for various percentages of the cost of the service, and also provides a total amount that includes the tip.

The appropriate amount to tip servers depends on your service. 15% is appropriate for average service ; 20% if your server is above average. You should feel free to tip above 20% if you received excellent service. If you received poor service, it is better to talk to the manager than skip on the tip.

n the U.S., a tip of 15% of the before tax meal price is typically expected.
